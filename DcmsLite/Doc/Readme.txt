This application template was created by Binod Kumar on 21 Sep 2011.
It implements the Service/Repository pattern and supports globalization.

The mobile page displays a single input control. It always retains focus
and loses its value after each post back.

The desktop page makes an ajax call after each scan and displays the result
returned by the controller.

Sharad 19 Mar 2012: Updated steps for Renaming
==============================================
Replace Starter with DcmsRights in all files. Replace All will work. Choose Match Case but do not choose Match whole word.
Rename Areas/Starter to Areas/DcmsRights.
In Project Properties, set AssemblyName and Default Namespace to DcmsMobile.DcmsRights.
Rename Views/Starter folder to Views/DcmsRights.
Rename Areas/DcmsRights/Scripts/Starter.partial.js to Rename Areas/DcmsRights/Scripts/DcmsRights.partial.js
Rename Areas/DcmsRights/Content/Starter*.css to DcmsRights*.css
Areas/DcmsRights/Views/Shared/_layoutStarter*.cshtml _layoutDcmsRight*.cshtml

Now right click on T4MVC.tt file and Run the custom tool.

* At this point the application should run directly.

Rename solution from Starter to DcmsRights.

* Now the application should run through DcmsMobile as well.

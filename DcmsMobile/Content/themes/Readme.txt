-------------------

All new applications must use the theme Start1.10.0. Include jquery-ui.min.css in your projects. No other css from this folder should be included.


The themes were downloaded from http://jqueryui.com/download/

Theme base should never be used. It exists only to keep the Nuget installer happy.
Themes Default and start are deprecated and will be removed soon.

All user modification functions ensure that the user being modified has the DCMS8_USER role. All modifications are refused if the user does not have this role. This protects
against accidently modifying critical users such as dcms8, SYS, etc.

SecurityController implements the functionality to manage DCMS users.
 - Create Users. The created user is automatically granted connect thrpugh rights for dcms4 and dcms8. This is required for proxy operations. It is also automatically granted the role DCMS8_USER.
 - Delete Users. Only users who have the DCMS8_USER role can be deleted.
 - View user properties. Autocomplete displays only those users who have the role DCMS8_USER.
 - Reset Password. The user's password is changed to a temporary password and expired.
 - Unlock user. This provides the ability to unlock the user account which have got locked due to invalid passwords.
   There is no provision to lock a user. Reset Password can be used to prvent the user from logging in.
 - Kill session of any user forcefully.  

Auditing
--------
No special auditing features have been implemented. Oracle 11g auditing features can be utilized. How?...
OracleMembershipProvider must ensure that approriate audit rights are enabled.


Who has the power to manage rights?
-----------------------------------
A new role DCMS_MANAGER has been created which enables user rights assignments. This role can only be granted by the IT staff. Once this role has been granted to a user, that user can now
use this application to manage rights.
This role also enables execution of any DCMS functionality.

Issues
------
-Should the created user be asigned to some profile? Yes. How?
-When old user has change password and they are not give password properly, it is not give properly error message.

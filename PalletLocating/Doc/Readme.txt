This application template was created by Binod Kumar on 21 Sep 2011.
It implements the Service/Repository pattern and supports globalization.

The mobile page displays a single input control. It always retains focus
and loses its value after each post back.

The desktop page makes an ajax call after each scan and displays the result
returned by the controller.

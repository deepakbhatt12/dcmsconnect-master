</h2>
<p>
    This document is intended for warehouse managers, REQ module users and development
    team at Eclipse.</p>
<h2>
    Business Need</h2>
<p>
    REQ2 module is used for making requests for cartons in a warehouse and to assign inventory to these requests from numbered carton areas. 
    You can request cartons for various purposes. For example,
</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can request inventory for converting SKUs.</li>
    <li>Request inventory for opening to shelf (SHL).</li>
    <li>Request inventory for performing some work on it like cleaning SKUs.</li>
     <li>You can request inventory to an area for shipping to customer..</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    Request for Conversion</h2>
<p>
    A request for conversion of source SKU is created through REQ2 program. User
    can specify the request of conversion by checking the check box "Conversion Request" 
    given in the main UI of the program. This optimizes the UI for making a conversion request.
    </p>
<h2>
    UI Options available</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enter source area from where inventory is to be pulled for the request.You can only request from numbered carton areas.</li>
    <li>Enter destination area where inventory pulled will be taken to. All carton areas are
        shown here. </li>
    <li>Enter UPC/ (Style, Color, Dimension, and SKU Size) of the SKU to be pulled.
    </li>
    <li>Enter Priority for these requirements and system makes sure that request with the
        highest priority is given precedence. Priority can only be set at requirement level
        and not SKU level.</li>
    <li>UI provides you filters which include price season code, sewing plant code, receive date and when you assign inventory to the request system makes sure 
    that only the cartons fulfilling filter criteria are selected. </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    De-assignment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When the request is created but cartons are not pulled to destination area the user
        can de-assign the request.This makes the cartons avaialble for other engagements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Inventory Hiding</h2>
   <P>
    User can hide the inventory from ERP by using this feature. This feature is useful when you 
    have to do some work on the inventory before making it shippable and you want to hide the inventory from
    ERP so that they do not drop orders for it. 
    To hide inventory just downgrade the quality of cartons being selected against this request.
    REQ2 UI provides this option when you create a new request. As soon as you finished working on these cartons just upgrade the quality 
    to shippable quality and you are now ready to ship these cartons.

        To create a new receiving session, you must supply basic information such as PRO

        the create button is pressed, you can continue to <a href="#scanning_pallet">

        Continue an existing Receiving Session
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you continue an existing receiving session, you will find that your most recent
        pallets are already visible on the screen. A pallet is a candidate for being visible
        only if all of its cartons belong to the Receiving or the Spot Check Area (i.e.
        RCV or AWS). If the pallet you are interested in is not already visible, simply
        scan it to make it visible.

    <h2 id="send_email_alert">
        Send an email alert

    <p>
        An e-mail alert can be generated by Receiver whenever a new SKU is received and this SKU is not assigned in the building. This alert is intended
        to indicate that a new location assignment is needed in BIR.
        When a new receiving session is created, the user will have the option to specify whether
        alerts are desired. If alerts are desired, the user can specify the area where location
        assignments should be checked, and the e-mail address to which the alert should be delivered.
        The choice will be stored on the user’s machine so that all future receiving from that
        machine will default to the same alert settings.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scanning_pallet">
        Scanning a Pallet
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the pallet you have scanned is already open, it will become the active pallet
        on the screen. If it is not open, a new tab will be added which will display the
        contents of the scanned pallet. In either case, you can now scan cartons to place
        on this pallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that only one pallet per disposition can be open. If another pallet of the
        same disposition is open, this pallet scan will be rejected. This also implies that
        only one empty pallet can be open at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this pallet already contains cartons, they will be displayed on your screen.
        For convenience, you can scan any carton on the pallet to make that pallet active
        . If the pallet contains enough cartons already, you will be asked whether you want
        to close the pallet. You can ignore pallet limit and keep putting more cartons on
        the pallet. However, you will have to confirm each time. This is by design, because
        we wanted to irritate you somewhat if you are exceeding pallet capacity.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scanning_carton">
        Scanning a Carton
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the carton has alredy been received, then as a convenience, that pallet will
        be made active. This is a great way to make a pallet active by scanning any carton
        on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The carton disposition must match the disposition of the active pallet. If this
        is not the case an error will be displayed. If an open pallet with the same disposition
        exists, you will be asked to scan that pallet. If there is no open pallet for that
        disposition, you will be asked to scan a new pallet.
    </p>
    <h2 id="correcting_mistakes">
        Correcting Mistakes
    </h2>
    <p>
        A common mistake might be to receive a carton unintentionally. If this happens,
        you should click the tab for the pallet on which the carton has been received. If
        the pallet is no longer open, you can scan it to open it. You will see the carton
        listed in the carton list of the pallet. Hover on the carton to get an opportunity
        to unreceive the carton.

        Option for closing pallet in screen is provided via the cross button on the tabs.
        Clicking on the button will remove the pallet from the screen.

    <h2 id="pallet_limit">
        Pallet Limit
    </h2>
    <p>
        Pallet Limit can be set when you create a new receiving process. We remember you same limit when you create a new process next time.
        You can however change it or edit it whenever you want. If you forget to set pallet limit the factory default is 50 cartons per pallet.

    <h2 id="sounds">
        Sounds
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you are making no mistakes at all, then the only sounds you will encounter are
        <code>Success</code> sounds. The success sounds are different for carton and pallet
        scans. When you make mistakes,

        Sounds are intended to play only to confirm your scanning. Sounds do no play when
        you use the mouse to navigate the GUI.

                Your browser does not support the HTML5 Audio element.
            </audio>
            Each time a carton is successfully received, you hear this sound. This is the sound
            you will be hearing most of the time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Active Pallet Changed</dt>
        <dd>
            Whenever you scan a carton that does not match the disposition of the current pallet, you hear one of these numeric sounds.
            The number played by the sound corresponds to the dispositon to which the scanned carton belongs.
        </dd>
        <dt>Pallet Scanned</dt>
        <dd>
            Each time a pallet is scanned or a new pallet created you hear this sound
        </dd>
        <dt>Warning</dt>
        <dd>
            This sound plays when something unusual occurs, but the occurence can be safely
            ignored. For example, it plays when you intiate someone else's receiving session,
            the pallet limit is being exceeded. This sound plays twice if the warning cannot
            be ignored. For example, when the carton cannot be placed on the active pallet because
            it has a different disposition, this sound will play twice. It means that your scan
            will keep getting ignored until you take some corrective action.

            </audio>
            We hope you never hear this sound. This means that your scan has been ignored due
            to circumstances beyond your control. For example, this sound will play if database
            errors are being encountered.

        Mobile Receiving
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can receive and palletize cartons using a ring scanner. To begin, you must first
        select the process against which you wish to receive. The process can only be created
        using a desktop. Once created, any number of receivers can receive against that
        process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process starts by scanning a pallet, and then scan each carton you wish to place
        on the pallet. Once the pallet is complete, scan the next pallet and continue.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mobile receiving experience is very similar to the desktop receiving experience
        with some minor exceptions.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Printing carton ticket not possible</em>. Printing of a carton ticket is rarely
            needed. If the need does arise, you must go to a desktop to print it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Unreceiving not possible</em>. Unreceiving is an edge case and is rarely necessary.
            It can only be performed using a desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Open Pallets</em>. Beacause of screen real estate limitations, only the active
            pallet information is displayed on the screen. Other open pallets are not displayed.
            You can scan any pallet at any time to make it active and see what cartons it contains.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Pallet disposition</em>. The UI does honor pallet dispositions by ensuring that
            each pallet contains cartons of the same disposition. However, if a carton is scanned
            which cannot be placed on the active pallet due to a disposition mismatch, it is
            rejected. Unlike the desktop version, the mobile version does not suggest which
            pallet can be scanned to accommodate the carton. Instead, it displays the disposition
            of the carton and you must search for the pallet yourself. Therefor Ringscanner
            works best when cartons of the same disposition are placed together on the truck.
            If heavy sortation is needed, the desktop version is recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Sounds.</em> Only two sounds are used. Success sound if the scan is accepted;
            error sound if the scan is rejected.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="spot_check">
        Spot Checking
    </h2>
    <p>
        When a carton is first scanned, a coin toss decides whether
        this carton needs to be spot checked. This decision is then remembered and the coin
        will not be tossed again if the carton is scanned again. During mobile operations,
        it is best to stow cartons for spot checking to some seperate physical space. Another
        receiver can be responsible for palletizing these cartons on to a spot check pallet
    </p>

    <p>
        Spot check percentage for configuration i.e Sewing plant,Style,Color is set by RAD program.
        User can enable/disbale configuration.In case configuration is disable then receving program doesn't sent
        cartons matching with configuration for spot check

    <h3>Conversion</h3>
    <div class="boxContent">
        <p>
            To convert SKUs in SHL, you normally have to repack them, locate them to BIR and then create a conversion pull request to pull them. Using the links below you can bypass all these steps
            and create cartons which can be directly taken to the conversion area. Conversion information means one or more of Target SKU, Target Virtual Warehous and Target Quality Code.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Repack for Conversion", MVC_Repack.Repack.Home.RepackConversion()). This is useful when you have few pieces each of a large number of SKUs.

                </li>
                <li>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Bulk Repack for Conversion", MVC_Repack.Repack.Home.RepackBulkConversion()). Use this when you need to convert a large number of pieces of a few SKUs.
You will be able to quickly create multiple identical cartons.

Design Thinking:
We will allow loading only those pallets which contain all verified boxes.

1- When the truck arrives at gate, loaders enter the appointment number and we suggest a pallet randomely. 
2- Scan to Truck UI (New) will be used to scan pallets to truck
4- UI asks for appointment number
5- Displays door where pallets are needed.
6- Suggest a single pallets. 
7- Suggestions sorted by bol/location (need of temp_load_pallet), we do not enforce suggestions.
8- Scan Pallet. Load in truck. We suggest next pallet till all the pallets of the given appointment are loaded on truck.
13- UI displays truck loading progress.

Special cases:
1.

ScanToTruck UI ===============
Design Thinking:
A pallet is shippable if all it's cartons are verified (does not include those pallets which are cancelled.). 
User enters the appointment number. We show the the building and area where verified pallets are kept. User enters a choice and we remember 
this choice for the session.

Screen 1
Enter appointment: 
Screen 2
Show summary info per area. We show building, area and no of pallets to be loaded.

Enter your choice
1: FDC => FDK : 40 pallets not loaded.
2: FDC => RDK : 20 Pallets not loaded.

Suspense handeling:
Show the pallets which are in suspense in the UI show operator as well.

User enters an area. 
User will choose an area and we remememebr it. Rest of the suggestions will be made from this area until user explicitly changes it. User cannot skip area becuase it is not our design to support a rare scenario when pallets are scattered all over the areas. 
Option to skip Pallet (UI message: Enter 9 to skip pallet, all boxes will be put in suspense.) 
Show the pallets which are in progress (by looking in temp_pull_pallet) 
Option to Undo pallet loading. =================*******================================================*******=========================================
GetSuggestedPallet(appointmentId, operatorName, areaId, buildingId, buddyPallet) 
1. All boxes in the pallet must be verified and present in the passed area. 
Get all qualifying pallets(not loaded, not in temp_pul_pallet and verified) of the passed appointment order by location (do we need travel sequence). 
Remove all expired cartons. 
LoadPallet(PalletId)
Update truck load date, productivity 
UnloadPallet(PalletId)
RemovesTruckLoadDate. =============================********************************=================================================

Meeting between Dinesh and Deepak
Temp_Load_Pallet concept is needed for following features.
1. If we want to make suggestions per bol. (Not to be done in this phase becuase the solution appears to be costly and I am sure whether it will
   bring about any major improvements.)
2. We cannot guarantee that same pallet will not be suggested to two different loaders.
